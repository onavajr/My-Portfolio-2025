                        Hello! I'm Orlando Nava, a passionate web developer and designer with a knack    for creating beautiful and functional websites. With a background in computer science and a love for design, I blend technical skills with creativity to deliver exceptional digital experiences. In my portfolio, you'll find a selection of my projects that showcase my expertise in front-end and back-end development, as well as my ability to work with various technologies and frameworks. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing my skills through continuous learning. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about me!
